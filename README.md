## Overview
The **Course Completion Prediction** project aims to predict the likelihood of users completing online courses based on their engagement data, ratings, feedback, and other relevant factors. This project uses machine learning algorithms to derive actionable insights that help in understanding user behavior and optimizing course offerings for higher completion rates.

## Objectives
- Analyze user engagement and feedback data to understand factors influencing course completion.
- Use machine learning algorithms to predict whether a user will complete a course.
- Provide insights to help in the development and improvement of future courses.

## Dataset
- **Name**: `online_course_engagement_data.csv`
- **Description**: The dataset contains information about user interactions, feedback, course ratings, and completion status for various online courses.
- **Key Features**:
  - `user_id`: Unique identifier for users.
  - `course_id`: Unique identifier for courses.
  - `time_spent`: Total time spent on the course by the user.
  - `feedback_score`: Rating provided by users for the course.
  - `modules_completed`: Number of course modules completed.
  - `completion_status`: Target variable indicating whether the course was completed.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau
- **Environment**: Google Colab

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains the `online_course_engagement_data.csv` dataset.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, preprocessing, modeling, and visualization.
- **models/**: Saved models and configurations.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and converting data types.
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends, patterns, and relationships.
   - Feature engineering to create new attributes that improve model accuracy.

2. **Modeling**: 
   - Implemented various machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
   - Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - **Random Forest** was selected as the final model due to its superior performance.

3. **Model Evaluation**: 
   - Used confusion matrix, ROC curve, and cross-validation to assess model performance.
   - Fine-tuned hyperparameters for better accuracy and generalization.

4. **Data Visualization**: 
   - Created multiple visualizations to analyze user engagement and model predictions.
   - Visualizations included bar charts, pie charts, correlation heatmaps, and box plots.
   - Used **Tableau** for interactive dashboards.

## Results
- The final model achieved an accuracy of `XX%`, with a `YY%` recall for predicting course completion.
- Key insights include the strong correlation between user feedback score and course completion rates, and the significant impact of time spent on course engagement.
- Developed a strategy for targeted interventions to improve completion rates based on user behavior analysis.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/course-completion-prediction.git
   cd course-completion-prediction
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter notebook in Google Colab or locally to train and evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/course_completion_prediction.ipynb
   ```
4. Use the **Tableau dashboard** in the `visualizations/` folder for interactive analysis.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate more features like user demographics and browsing behavior to improve model accuracy.
- Explore deep learning models for more complex pattern recognition.
- Implement an A/B testing mechanism to validate the recommendations.
